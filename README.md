On-chain shorting via Aave and Uniswap.

## Principles

The following outlines principles for core protocol funcitonality.

1. Immutable.
2. No Governance.
3. No Admin Keys.

## To-Do

Logic:

-   Move PositionAdmin to services, rename
-   [ ] Consider changing short() to add()
-   [ ] Emit event when a position is created (get clear on whether or not an implicit event is emitted when creating a contract)

Tests:

-   [ ] Invariant: the clientTakeRate + userTakeRate = clientRate
-   [ ] Invariant: the totalTokenAmt - sum(clientFeesToken) = (1 - clientRate) \* totalTokenAmt
-   [ ] Unit test setClientTakeRate()
-   [ ] Unit test getUserSavings()
-   [ ] Unit test FeeLib via Test Harness
-   [ ] Account for userSavings in all affected FeeCollector unit and integration tests

Considerations:

-   None at the momentðŸ™‚
